this was possible because of abstractions (servers)
- AWS or a "Platform" team that leveraged some of the operation tasks to allow a dev team to become more ops

If we create an abstractions on the devices differencies we can allow feature team to deploy their feature in production

‚ÄúThe First Way emphasizes the performance of the entire system, as opposed to the performance of a specific silo of work or department.‚Äù

# From Code to Customers #2

Same image but with feature teams & devices teams

Same image but with dev & ops

<!--
- EUREKA! -> I've already seen this one, it's DevOps
- DevOps: Development & Operations teams were indipendent squads, each own with its own goal
Official Definition: "a software engineering culture and practice, that aims at unifying software development and software operation."

# The Power of Abstraction

DevOps was born because of abstractions

Call it AWS, GCP, Azure, or simply a Platform team that build tools for teams to be autonomous from dev to ops.

To apply the devops concept, what's the right abstractions that we need ?

---

# [fit] DevOps
# [fit] for
# [fit] Frontend

---

# One team, two abstractions

Ease the differencies between devices

---

# Abstraction #1
# _**Runtime - Bootstrap**_

- Remotes & Controllers
- Device APIs
- Networking
- Background/Foreground

[.column]

---

# Abstraction #2
# _**Buildtime - Tools**_

- Develop on device
- Debugging on device
- Monitoring
- Test Automation on device (TV Lab)

---

# TV Platform team & Feature teams

Updated image laptop -> customers

---

# Maximise the flow - Lead Time

- Make work visible: single team Jira board
- Reduce batch size: up to the feature teams
- Prevent defect being passed downstream: developing on devices, automation for testing
- always optimise for the global goals: YEY

---

# Takeaways

- DevOps is about unifying and enabling
- The Backend it's just the beginning
- Measure
- Improve
- Repeat
